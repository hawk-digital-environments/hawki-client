# Chapter 5: Room Management

In the [previous chapter](user-and-profile-management-20863976.md), we learned how to manage your identity and look up other users. Now that we know *who* we are talking to, let's explore *where* these conversations happen: in chat rooms.

This chapter introduces `client.rooms`, the most comprehensive feature module in `hawki-client`. It's your one-stop-shop for everything related to chat rooms, from creating them to sending messages inside them.

### Your Organized Workspace: `client.rooms`

Imagine you're managing a shared digital workspace. You have one central dashboard, `client.rooms`, for an overview of all the project rooms. From this dashboard, you can perform high-level actions like creating a new room or seeing a list of all existing rooms.

But for specific tasks within a room, you have specialized assistants:
*   Want to read or send messages? You talk to the "Messages" assistant (`client.rooms.messages`).
*   Need to see who's in the room or manage their roles? You ask the "Members" assistant (`client.rooms.members`).
*   Want to see who's typing right now? You glance at the "Typing Indicator" panel (`client.rooms.typing`).

This is exactly how `client.rooms` is structured. It's a main feature that provides sub-handles for more specific, domain-driven tasks. This keeps the API clean, organized, and easy to understand.

### Core Operations: Creating and Listing Rooms

Let's start with the basics. The `client.rooms` object itself allows you to create, list, and update rooms directly.

#### Listing All Your Rooms

The most common first step is to get a list of all rooms you're a member of. The `list()` method returns a reactive store that contains an array of `Room` objects, automatically sorted by the most recent activity.

```javascript
const roomListStore = client.rooms.list();

roomListStore.subscribe(rooms => {
  console.log(`You are a member of ${rooms.length} rooms.`);
  // In a real app, you would render this list to the UI.
  // For example: <ul>...<li>Room 1</li>...</ul>
});
```
Because this is a reactive store, as you are added to new rooms or as activity happens, this list will update automatically, keeping your UI perfectly in sync.

#### Creating a New Room

Creating a new chat room is a single, asynchronous call to `create()`. Just provide a name, and you're good to go. The current user will automatically be made an administrator of the new room.

```javascript
async function createNewProjectRoom() {
  const newRoom = await client.rooms.create({
    name: 'Project Phoenix Planning'
  });

  console.log(`Successfully created room: ${newRoom.name} (ID: ${newRoom.id})`);
}
```
This function handles all the backend communication and returns the freshly created `Room` object.

### The Specialized Assistants: Messages, Members, and Typing

Now let's dive into the sub-handles that make `client.rooms` so powerful.

#### `client.rooms.messages`: The Communication Desk

This handle is your go-to for all message-related actions within a specific room.

To list messages, you call `messages.list(room)`. To send one, you call `messages.send(room, content)`.

```javascript
// Assume 'selectedRoom' is a Room object we got from client.rooms.list()

// List all messages in the selected room
const messageStore = client.rooms.messages.list(selectedRoom);
messageStore.subscribe(messages => {
  console.log(`Displaying ${messages.length} messages.`);
  // ... render messages to the screen
});

// Send a new message to that room
await client.rooms.messages.send(
  selectedRoom,
  'Hello everyone, letâ€™s get started!'
);
```
Here, we first subscribe to the message list for a `selectedRoom`. Then, we send a new message. As soon as the message is sent, the `messageStore` will automatically update, and our subscription will run again with the new message included.

#### `client.rooms.members`: The Participant Roster

This handle lets you manage the people inside a room. You can see who is a member, what their role is (admin, member), and even invite new people.

```javascript
// Again, assume 'selectedRoom' is a Room object

// Get a reactive list of all members in the room
const memberStore = client.rooms.members.list(selectedRoom);

memberStore.subscribe(members => {
  const names = members.map(m => m.user.displayName).join(', ');
  console.log(`Members in this room: ${names}`);
});
```
This is great for building a user list panel for your chat room. The `list()` method cleverly combines data from the room's member list with user profiles to give you rich objects that include the user's name, avatar, and more.

#### `client.rooms.typing`: The Real-Time Status Board

Want to show that little "..." indicator when someone is typing? The `typing` handle makes this incredibly simple.

It provides a reactive store of who is currently typing, and methods to announce your own typing status to others.

```javascript
// Assume 'selectedRoom' is a Room object

// Subscribe to see who is typing
const typingUsersStore = client.rooms.typing.state(selectedRoom);

typingUsersStore.subscribe(users => {
  if (users.length > 0) {
    const names = users.map(u => u.displayName).join(', ');
    console.log(`${names} is typing...`);
  } else {
    console.log(''); // Clear the typing indicator
  }
});

// When your user starts typing in an input field...
// client.rooms.typing.start(selectedRoom);

// When they stop or send the message...
// client.rooms.typing.stop(selectedRoom);
```
By subscribing to `typing.state()`, your UI can react instantly to typing events from other users.

### What Happens Under the Hood?

The `RoomFeature` is a master of delegation. It constructs its specialized sub-handles and then exposes them to you. When you call a method like `client.rooms.messages.send()`, a coordinated effort begins.

Let's visualize the flow of sending a message.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Your App
    participant Messages as client.rooms.messages
    participant Keychain as client.keychain
    participant Backend as HAWKI Backend
    participant DB as Local Database

    App->>Messages: call send(room, 'Hello!')
    Messages->>Keychain: Get encryption keys for this room
    Keychain-->>Messages: Return room keys
    Note over Messages: Encrypts 'Hello!' with the key
    Messages->>Backend: Send encrypted message
    Backend-->>Messages: Message sent successfully
    Messages->>DB: Store new message locally
    Note over DB, App: The reactive message list store updates, and the UI refreshes
```

This flow shows a beautiful separation of concerns:
1.  **The App:** Simply calls `send` with plain text.
2.  **The `RoomMessagesHandle`:** Orchestrates the process. It knows it needs to encrypt the message before sending.
3.  **The `Keychain`:** Is the security expert. It securely provides the necessary encryption keys, as you'll learn in [End-to-End Encryption and The Keychain](end-to-end-encryption-and-the-keychain-1491275150.md).
4.  **The `Database`:** Acts as a local cache, ensuring your app feels fast and responsive. We'll cover this in [Data Persistence: Resources and the Database](data-persistence-resources-and-the-database-983608291.md).

Let's look at the source code to see how `RoomFeature` is put together.

In `src/internal/rooms/RoomFeature.ts`, you can see the feature being defined. It creates instances of the sub-handles and then returns them as properties.

```typescript
// A simplified view from src/internal/rooms/RoomFeature.ts
export const RoomFeature = defineFeature((connection) => {
  // 1. Create the specialist assistants
  const typingHandle = createRoomTypingHandle(connection);
  const membersHandle = createRoomMembersHandle(connection);
  const messagesHandle = createRoomMessagesHandle(connection, membersHandle);

  // ... functions for create(), list(), update() ...

  // 2. Return everything in an organized object
  return {
    create,
    list,
    update,
    // ... more core functions
    get typing() { return typingHandle; },
    get messages() { return messagesHandle; },
    get members() { return membersHandle; }
  };
});
```
This code clearly shows the "manager and specialists" structure. The `RoomFeature` initializes all its helpers (`typingHandle`, `membersHandle`, etc.) and then exposes them through `get` properties, which is why you can access them as `client.rooms.typing`. This lazy loading and clear structure makes the entire `RoomFeature` powerful yet easy to maintain and understand.

### Conclusion

You've now explored the most feature-rich part of `hawki-client`. You have a solid understanding of how to manage the entire lifecycle of a chat room.

You have learned:
*   `client.rooms` is the central hub for all room-related functionality.
*   You can perform high-level operations like `create` and `list` directly on `client.rooms`.
*   For specific tasks, you use the specialized sub-handles: `messages`, `members`, and `typing`.
*   This hierarchical design provides a clean, organized, and powerful API for building chat features.
*   Behind the scenes, these handles work together with other features like the `Keychain` and the local database to provide a secure and responsive experience.

We've mentioned encryption several times in this chapter. Sending a message involves encrypting its content so that only room members can read it. How does this work? The next chapter will pull back the curtain on this critical security feature.
