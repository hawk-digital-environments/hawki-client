# Chapter 4: User and Profile Management

In the [previous chapter](reactive-state-management-with-stores-1007900773.md), we explored how `hawki-client` uses reactive stores to manage data that changes over time. Now, let's look at one of the most common types of data you'll work with: users.

Every collaborative application revolves around its users. You need to know who you are, update your own information, and see who else is in a conversation. In `hawki-client`, this is handled by two distinct but related features: `client.users` and `client.profile`. This chapter will teach you how to use them to manage user data and your personal profile.

### The Phonebook and Your Wallet

To understand the difference between `client.users` and `client.profile`, let's use an analogy.

*   `client.users` is like a public company phonebook. You can use it to look up information about *any* user you have access toâ€”their name, their department (or bio), and their photo. It's a read-only directory.
*   `client.profile` is like your personal wallet and business card. It's specifically for managing *your own* identity. You can get your own details quickly, update your name, change your photo, or write a new bio. You can't use your wallet to change someone else's business card.

This separation keeps things clean: `users` is for looking up data, and `profile` is for acting on your own data.

### Managing Your Own Profile: `client.profile`

Let's start with the most common task: working with the currently logged-in user. The `client.profile` feature is your dedicated toolkit for this.

#### Getting Your Own User Data

How do you get your own profile? The `me()` method gives you a reactive store containing your user object. Since it's a store, you can `subscribe` to it and your UI will update automatically if your profile ever changes.

```javascript
// Get the reactive store for the current user's profile
const myProfileStore = client.profile.me();

// Subscribe to display your name and bio
myProfileStore.subscribe(myProfile => {
  if (myProfile) {
    document.getElementById('name').innerText = myProfile.displayName;
    document.getElementById('bio').innerText = myProfile.bio;
  }
});
```
In this snippet, we get the store from `client.profile.me()` and subscribe to it. Now, any part of our app that updates the profile will automatically trigger this code, keeping our UI perfectly in sync.

#### Updating Your Details

What if you want to change your display name or bio? The `update()` method lets you do just that. You pass it an object with the fields you want to change.

```javascript
async function saveNewBio() {
  const newBio = 'Learning to use hawki-client!';

  try {
    await client.profile.update({ bio: newBio });
    console.log('Profile updated successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to update profile:', error);
  }
}
```
Here, we call `client.profile.update()` with a new bio. The library sends this change to the HAWKI backend. Once it succeeds, other parts of your app subscribed to `client.profile.me()` will automatically receive the updated profile!

#### Setting a New Avatar

Changing your profile picture is just as simple. The `setAvatar()` method takes a `File` object (which you can get from an `<input type="file">` element) and handles the entire upload process for you.

```javascript
// Assume 'fileInput' is an <input type="file"> element
const selectedFile = fileInput.files[0];

if (selectedFile) {
  // The 'setAvatar' method returns an object to track the upload
  const upload = client.profile.setAvatar(selectedFile);

  upload.progress.subscribe(p => console.log(`Upload is ${p.percent}% complete`));
  await upload.finished();

  console.log('New avatar has been set!');
}
```
We grab the file from the input and pass it to `setAvatar()`. The library takes care of the complex process of uploading the file, which you can learn more about in [Network and File Transfers](network-and-file-transfers-715941119.md).

### Looking Up Other Users: `client.users`

Now, let's use the "phonebook." The `client.users` feature lets you access data about *all* users your client is aware of (usually, users you share a room with).

#### Getting a List of All Users

To get a list of all known users, you can use the `list()` method. Just like `profile.me()`, this returns a reactive store that you can subscribe to.

```javascript
const allUsersStore = client.users.list();

allUsersStore.subscribe(users => {
  console.log(`There are ${users.length} users in the directory.`);
  // You could now render this list in your UI
});
```
This gives you a constantly updated array of user objects.

#### Finding One Specific User

If you already know a user's ID and just need their details, the `one()` method is more efficient. It returns a store for that single user.

```javascript
// Get the store for the user with ID 123
const userStore = client.users.one(123);

userStore.subscribe(user => {
  if (user) {
    console.log(`Found user: ${user.displayName}`);
  } else {
    console.log('User 123 not found or not synced yet.');
  }
});
```
This is perfect for when you need to display information about a specific member of a chat room.

### What Happens Under the Hood?

Let's peek behind the curtain to see how `hawki-client` splits these responsibilities.

#### `client.profile` is a Helpful Assistant

The `ProfileFeature` is surprisingly simple. It acts as a convenient assistant that uses other, more fundamental features to get its job done.

When you call `client.profile.me()`, the profile feature simply turns around and asks the `client.users` feature for the user object matching your own ID.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Your App
    participant Profile as client.profile
    participant Users as client.users

    App->>Profile: Call me()
    Note over Profile: "I know the current user's ID is 42."
    Profile->>Users: Call one(42)
    Users-->>Profile: Return store for user 42
    Profile-->>App: Return store for user 42
```

This is clearly visible in the source code. The `me()` function is just a shortcut.

```typescript
// in src/internal/profile/ProfileFeature.ts
const ProfileFeature = defineFeature((connection) => {
  const currentUserId = connection.userinfo.id;

  const me = () =>
    connection.client.users.one(currentUserId);

  // ...other methods like update() and setAvatar()
  
  return { me, /* ... */ };
});
```
When you call `update()` or `setAvatar()`, however, the `ProfileFeature` makes a direct network request to the HAWKI backend, because these are actions that modify data on the server.

#### `client.users` is a Librarian

The `UserFeature` acts like a librarian for your local data. As you interact with HAWKI, data about users you encounter is synchronized and stored in a local database. You can learn more about this in [Data Persistence: Resources and the Database](data-persistence-resources-and-the-database-983608291.md).

When you call `client.users.one(123)`, the `UserFeature` doesn't make a new network request. Instead, it queries its local database for that user's record.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Your App
    participant Users as client.users
    participant DB as Local Resource Database

    App->>Users: Call one(123)
    Users->>DB: Query for user with id '123'
    DB-->>Users: Return user record
    Note over Users: Convert record to User model...
    Users-->>App: Return store with User object
```

This design makes your app fast and efficient. User data is loaded from the local cache instantly, and it's kept up-to-date by a separate background synchronization process.

Here's a glimpse of the code in `UserFeature.ts`:

```typescript
// in src/internal/users/UserFeature.ts
const UserFeature = defineFeature((connection) => {
  const records = connection.resourceDb.getTable('user');

  const one = (id: number) =>
    records.one.get(id.toString(), id)
      .derive('model', (resource) => /* ... convert to user object ... */);

  const list = () =>
    records.list.get('default')
      .derive('models', (resources) => /* ... convert all ... */);

  return { one, list, /* ... */ };
});
```
You can see that both `one()` and `list()` are calling `records...`, which is a direct interface to the local database table for users.

### Conclusion

You've now learned how to interact with one of the most fundamental data types in HAWKI: users.

You now know that:
*   User-related logic is split into two features: `client.users` for looking up anyone, and `client.profile` for managing your own data.
*   `client.profile` provides convenient helpers like `me()`, `update()`, and `setAvatar()`.
*   `client.users` provides reactive stores to get a `list` of all synced users or `one` specific user by their ID.
*   Behind the scenes, the `ProfileFeature` is a convenient wrapper, while the `UserFeature` is a fast, database-backed directory of known users.

Now that you can manage users, the next logical step is to see where you'll interact with them: in chat rooms.
